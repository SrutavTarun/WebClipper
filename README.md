## WorkFlow
</u>

### Initial Stage
- We created a chrome extension from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
### Present stage
- We have created a clean, exquisite and minimalistic UI. <p> 
- We have also added a feature of getting the url of the websites into display.<p>
-  Along with that the selected text is also incorporated into the extension while browsing the specific website.
### Future plans
- The extension doesn't identify the id of the selected text as of now. So we plan to incoporate a scrolling mechanism to visit the bookmarked text. 
- To add local storage provision or database using indexedDB to store the set of URLs and ids. Rigth now we used array mechanism so it gets refreshed when we close the browser.
- To add as many bookmarks as possible, currently only 3 can be added from a particular site and only 3 sites can be bookmarked at a time
